The Moving Truck Metaphor
The network is like a road.
The moving truck represents Internet Protocol (IP), which transports data.
Inside the truck is a box, which represents data being sent.
The truck doesn’t care what’s in the box; it just moves it from one place to another.
Once the box arrives, it’s unpacked, and the data inside is used.
Breaking Down the Data Transfer Process
Your device (computer, phone, etc.) communicates with a server (website, email service, etc.) by sending data in layers:

Ethernet frame → The truck on the road.
IP packet → The truck carrying the box.
TCP/UDP segment → The box inside the truck.
Application data → The content inside the box.
TCP vs. UDP (Two Ways to Send Data)
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
✔ Like certified mail – ensures delivery with tracking.
✔ Establishes a connection before sending data.
✔ Guarantees that data arrives in order and re-sends lost data.
✔ Used for:

Web browsing (HTTP, HTTPS).
Emails (SMTP, IMAP, POP3).
Secure connections (SSH, FTPS).
UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
✔ Like dropping a postcard in a mailbox – no confirmation if received.
✔ No connection setup – just sends data quickly.
✔ No re-sending of lost data.
✔ Used for:

Live video streaming (YouTube, Netflix).
Voice calls (VoIP) (Zoom, Skype).
Online gaming (low latency needed).
Port Numbers: How Data Gets Delivered Correctly
✔ Every computer/server has an IP address (like a house address).
✔ Inside that computer, different applications/services have port numbers (like rooms in a house).
✔ Common port numbers:

Port 80 (HTTP) → Web browsing.
Port 443 (HTTPS) → Secure web browsing.
Port 25 (SMTP) → Sending emails.
Port 123 (NTP) → Time synchronization.
How a Client Communicates with a Server
1️⃣ The client (your device) picks a random port number to start communication.
2️⃣ It sends data to a well-known port number on the server.

Example:
Your computer wants to visit a website.
It picks port 3000 (random) and sends a request to the server’s port 80 (HTTP).
The server replies back to port 3000, completing the communication.
Multiplexing (Handling Multiple Conversations at Once)
✔ Your device talks to many services at once using different port numbers:

Web browsing on port 80.
Email on port 143.
Voice call on port 5004.
✔ Each connection has a unique combination of:

IP addresses.
Port numbers.
✔ This keeps conversations separate.
Why Port Numbers Matter
✔ They ensure data reaches the right application.
✔ Well-known port numbers simplify communication.
✔ Changing port numbers doesn’t add security – hackers can still scan for open ports.
