I'll create study notes for Software Defined Networking (SDN) based on this document:

# Software Defined Networking (SDN) Study Notes

## Overview
- Cloud computing changed traditional networking
- Physical routers, switches, etc. replaced by virtualized components
- SDN converts physical network infrastructure into software-based platforms
- Separates device functions into individual software components

## SDN Architecture Layers

### 1. Infrastructure Layer (Data Plane)
- Handles packet-level operations
- Responsible for:
  - Forwarding packets
  - Trunking
  - Encryption
  - Network Address Translation (NAT)
  - Other packet-level functions
- Carries the actual network traffic

### 2. Control Layer (Control Plane)
- Provides intelligence and reference information for the data plane
- Contains:
  - Dynamic routing protocols
  - Forwarding tables (for switches)
  - NAT tables (for routers)
  - Other decision-making logic
- Tells the data plane where to send traffic

### 3. Application Layer (Management Plane)
- Interface for managing network devices
- Accessed through:
  - SSH (Secure Shell)
  - SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)
  - APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)
  - Graphical interfaces
- Allows administrators to configure and monitor devices

## Benefits of SDN Architecture
- Creates modular layers that can extend between different devices
- Enables creation of new network devices through software
- Allows communication between specific layers across different devices
- Provides consistent architecture across different networking components
- Supports deployment in cloud environments
- Creates software versions of physical network infrastructure

## Physical vs. Software Implementation
- Traditional physical switch/router: all planes integrated in one device
- SDN: separates functions into distinct software components
- Data plane handles traffic forwarding across interfaces
- Control plane contains tables and forwarding information
- Management plane provides the administrative interface
- No physical hardware required in pure SDN implementations

## Practical Applications
- Cloud-based networking infrastructure
- Virtualized network environments
- Software-based deployment of traditional network functions

Would you like me to expand on any specific area of Software Defined Networking or create practice questions to help you study this material?
