I'll help you create study notes from this networking equipment document. Here's a structured breakdown of the key concepts to study for your test:

# Network Infrastructure Devices Study Notes

## Routers
- Forwards traffic between different IP subnets
- Uses IP addresses to determine next hop to final destination
- Operates at Layer 3 of OSI model
- Can connect different network types (LAN, WAN, copper, fiber)
- Can be integrated into switches (Layer 3 switches)

## Switches
- Connects devices on a local network
- Forwards traffic based on destination MAC address
- Uses ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits) for fast throughput
- Many support Power over Ethernet (PoE)

### Types of Switches:
1. **Unmanaged Switches**
   - Limited functionality
   - No configuration options
   - No VLAN support
   - No SNMP capabilities
   - Lower cost option
   - All devices on same network segment

2. **Managed Switches**
   - Additional capabilities for monitoring and configuration
   - Supports VLAN configuration
   - Traffic prioritization options
   - Supports Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) for loop prevention
   - Port mirroring for troubleshooting
   - SNMP support

## Wireless Access Points
- Provides wireless connectivity to local networks
- Acts as a bridge between wireless and wired networks
- Not a router (doesn't route between subnets)
- Makes forwarding decisions based on MAC addresses (like switches)
- Does not perform NAT

## Patch Panels
- Connection point between user workstations and network equipment
- Permanent cable runs from workstations to patch panel
- Allows for easier network changes without modifying permanent wiring
- Typically uses RJ45 connectors on front side
- Reduces scope of problems during changes

## Firewalls
- Traditional firewalls operate at Layer 4 (port numbers, IP addresses)
- Modern firewalls can operate at Layer 7 (application layer)
- Can act as VPN endpoints for encrypted tunnels
- May function as proxies
- Often include routing capabilities (Layer 3)
- Commonly connected directly to internet

## Power over Ethernet (PoE)
- Provides power through ethernet cables
- Useful for devices where power sources are difficult to access
- Types:
  - **Endspan**: Power comes from switch
  - **Midspan**: Power injected by separate PoE injector

### PoE Standards:
1. **IEEE 802.3af (2003)**
   - 15.4 watts, 350mA max
   - Original PoE specification

2. **IEEE 802.3at (2009)**
   - 25.5 watts, 600mA max
   - Enhanced PoE

3. **IEEE 802.3bt (PoE++)**
   - Type 3: 51 watts, 600mA max
   - Type 4: 71.3 watts, 960mA max
   - Designed for 10Gbps ethernet

## Hubs (Outdated)
- Multi-port repeaters
- Copy data from one port to all other ports
- Half-duplex only
- Performance degrades with more devices
- Limited to 10/100 Mbps speeds
- Replaced by switches in modern networks

## Internet Connection Devices
1. **Cable Modems**
   - Uses DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification)
   - Supports broadband communication (multiple frequencies)
   - Can provide internet, TV, and phone service
   - Speeds up to 1 Gbps depending on provider

2. **DSL Modems**
   - Often ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line)
   - Uses telephone lines
   - Faster download than upload speeds
   - Distance limitation (~10,000 feet from Central Office)
   - Typical speeds: 52 Mbps down, 16 Mbps up

3. **Optical Network Terminal (ONT)**
   - Connects fiber networks to premises
   - Converts fiber signals to copper ethernet
   - Usually mounted outside building
   - Marks demarcation point (demarc) between ISP and customer networks

## Network Interface Cards (NICs)
- Required for any device connecting to a network
- Can be built into motherboard or added as expansion cards
- Available for different network types (ethernet, wireless, fiber, etc.)
- Some NICs have multiple ports/connectors
